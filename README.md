Problem Statement: The HR department of a large company wants to identify which employees are most likely to leave the company in the near future, in order to take proactive measures to retain them.

Data Collection: The HR department collects data on various employee characteristics such as their job role, tenure, salary, performance ratings, etc. They also collect data on which employees have left the company in the past.

Data Exploration and Cleaning: The data scientist explores the collected data to identify any missing values, outliers, or inconsistencies. They then clean the data and prepare it for analysis.

Feature Engineering: The data scientist creates new features from the existing data that may be useful in predicting employee turnover, such as the ratio of salary to the industry average for a given job role.

Model Building: The data scientist trains several machine learning models, such as logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest, to predict employee turnover based on the engineered features. They use techniques like cross-validation and grid search for selecting the best model.

Model Evaluation: The data scientist evaluates the performance of the best model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score. They also analyze the feature importance to understand which factors are the most important predictors of employee turnover.

Deployment: The data scientist deploys the best model in the production environment, and the HR department can use the model to predict employee turnover for new hires and current employees. The department can use this information to develop retention strategies and target specific employees who are at high risk of leaving.

Monitoring: The data scientist monitors the deployed model's performance, and retrains the model as needed when new data becomes available.
